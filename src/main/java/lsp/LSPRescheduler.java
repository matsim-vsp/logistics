/**
 * There is a possibility and also sometimes a need for rescheduling before each
 * new iteration. This need results from changes to the plan of the LSP during
 * the re-planning process. There, changes of the structure and/or number of the
 * active LogisticsSolutions or to the assignment of the LSPShipments to the
 * LogisticsSolutions can happen. Consequently, the transport operations that
 * result from this change in behavior of the corresponding LSP will also change
 * and thus the preparation of the simulation has to be redone.
 * <p>
 * The rescheduling process is triggered in the BeforeMobsimEvent of the following iteration which has
 * a LSPRescheduler as one of its listeners.
 * <p>
 * In this case, all LogisticsSolutions,
 * LogisticsSolutionElements and Resources are cleared of all shipments that
 * were assigned to them in the previous iteration in order to allow a new assignment.
 * <p>
 * Then, all LSPShipments of each LSP are assigned to the corresponding
 * LogisticsSolutions by the Assigner of the LSP in order to account for possible
 * changes in the LogisticsSolutions as well as in the assignment itself due to
 * the re-planning that took place before. After this assignment is done, the actual
 * scheduling takes place. In cases, where no re-planning takes place (further details of
 * the re-planning algorithm follow in 3.8), rescheduling will nevertheless take place.
 * This is reasonable for example in cases where also other traffic takes place on the
 * network, for example passenger traffic, and the network conditions change between
 * subsequent iterations of the simulation due to congestion.
 * <p>
 * ---
 * Let's do it in re-planning.
 * If doing so, we have the time to handle the result (on Carrier level) in the beforeMobsim step of the CarrierControlerListener.
